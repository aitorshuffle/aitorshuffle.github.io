This is Aitor Alvarez-Gila's personal webpage.

I am a lead researcher at [Tecnalia](https://www.tecnalia.com/en/)'s [Computer Vision and Visual Interaction group](https://www.tecnalia.com/en/technologies/computer-vision-and-visual-interaction).
My main research interests are deep learning and other machine learning / computer vision models for image and 3D understanding, and spectral imaging. **UPDATE 2022-:** I now also care about multimodal (e.g. Vision & Language) models and the latest trends in generative deep learning and 3D neural scene representations (e.g. NeRF, 3D Gaussians), of course, who doesn't?
Anyway, I have been building stuff that works based on these techniques since 2010 for biomedical, steelmaking, agro, waste management and packaging industries, among others.

I got my PhD on deep learning in 2022 from Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB). [The thesis]({{ site.url }}/posts/2022/07/phddefence/) was developed at [Computer Vision Center](http://www.cvc.uab.es/)'s [LAMP (Learning And Machine Perception)](http://lamp.cvc.uab.es/) team, under the supervision of [Joost van de Weijer (CVC)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Gsw2iUEAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Estibaliz Garrote](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=QGM4I_kAAAAJ) (Tecnalia). 
 
Prior to that, I completed the Erasmus Mundus CIMET Master (now [COSI-*Computational Colour and Spectral Imaging*](https://cosi-master.eu/)) in color science and computer vision and made research stays at the Universities of Granada (ES), Jean Monnet (Saint-Etienne, FR), NTNU (Gjøvik, NO) and UvA (Amsterdam, NL) from 2008 until 2010.

In past lives, I've also been a consultant in a dark suit working for multinational financial companies and public administration.

Even before that, I did some research on network security at the University of the Basque Country, where I first graduated as Telecommunications Engineer (2005).
