Our paper ["Deep convolutional neural networks for mobile capture device-based crop disease classification in the wild"]({{ site.url }}/publication/2018-04-16-johannes_deep_2018) just got accepted for publication at the [_Computers and Electronics in Agriculture_ journal](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/computers-and-electronics-in-agriculture).  
The paper, presented in collaboration with [BASF](https://www.basf.com), exends [our previous work]({{ site.url }}/publication/2017-05-09-johannes_automatic_2017), and describes how we migrated our classical computer vision workflow-based disease classification engine to a deep Convolutional Neural Networks-based solution, exhaustively tested in real field-conditions.

More info and full text available [here]({{ site.url }}/publication/2018-04-16-johannes_deep_2018)) soon.
