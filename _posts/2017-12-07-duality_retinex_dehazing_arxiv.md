Our paper [On the Duality Between Retinex and Image Dehazing]({{ site.url }}/publication/2017-12-07-galdran_duality_2017) is now available on arxiv through [this link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.02754).

In this work, we prove that image enhancement algorithms based on the retinex color vision model and dehazing algorithms based on Kochsmieder's model are related at a fundamental, modelling level. Extensive experiments show how we can obtain state of the art image dehazing results using retinex implementations over images with inverted intensities, and inverting back the result.
