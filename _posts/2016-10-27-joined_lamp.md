I have been officially admitted as PhD student at the [Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona](http://www.uab.cat/).
I will be joining [Computer Vision Center](http://www.cvc.uab.es/)'s [LAMP (Learning And Machine Perception)](http://www.cvc.uab.es/LAMP/) team under the supervision of [Joost van de Weijer](http://www.cvc.uab.es/LAMP/joost/) to work on deep learning. 

This is a part-time position, so I will keep working at [Tecnalia](http://www.tecnalia.com/en/)'s [Computer Vision](http://www.computervisionbytecnalia.com/en/) group.
