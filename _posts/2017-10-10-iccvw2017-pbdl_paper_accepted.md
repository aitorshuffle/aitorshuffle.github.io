Our paper [Adversarial Networks for Spatial Context-Aware Spectral Image Reconstruction from RGB]({{ site.url }}/publication/2017-10-10-alvarez-gila_adversarial_2017), has been accepted for oral presentation at the ICCV 2017 Workshop on [Physics-Based Vision meets Deep Learning](https://pbdl2017.github.io/), to be held next October 23rd in Venice, Italy.

The paper shows how we can use the framework provided by the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in a conditional setting in order to accurately reconstruct a hyperspectral image composed by 31 channels, taking only an RGB image as input. 

Full program and schedule for the workshop can be found [here](https://pbdl2017.github.io/program.html), and a detailed pdf version with the program for all the workshops is available [here](http://iccv2017.thecvf.com/files/ICCV_2017_Workshops_Tutorials.pdf)
